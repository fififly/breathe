# breathe: peripheral breath trainer ðŸ’¨ðŸ’¨

breathe is a (distraction-free) peripheral breath trainer, it helps you breathe correctly so you can stay calm and focus on what matters. Breathe's window is small and it always stays on top so you can look at it peripherally, while doing other stuff.

## Motivation

I created this project after reading some hn articles on how breathing correctly can help you focus and can calm you. I don't expect this to work for everyone but it does indeed work for me. Some of the articles:
- https://quietkit.com/box-breathing/
- https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jul/26/every-breath-you-take-the-lost-art-of-breathing
- https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-healing-power-of-proper-breathing-11590098696

- Download this gif breathe.gif: https://quietkit.com/img/box-breathing-4x-v03.gif

- Set it to a custom shortcut and press q to close window.
